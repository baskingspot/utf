# The summary at the end of `just bench-compare` (bench/README.md): for each
# operation, this package's throughput against each other arm's.
#
#     awk -f bench/summary.awk [-v rows=FILE] DIR/utf.txt DIR/simdutf.txt ...
#
# The first file is utf's; each holds `Benchmark<Row>/<input> <n> <GB/s> GB/s`
# lines, one per round, in round order, so the k-th line of a row in each
# file comes from the same round. `just bench-compare` times the arms on a
# row back to back, so a row's ratio in one round compares the arms on the
# same machine state. A row's ratio is the median over the rounds of
# utf's GB/s divided by the arm's in the same round, with a 95% confidence
# interval from the order statistics, as benchstat's; an operation's ratio
# is the geometric mean of its rows'. Above 1, utf is faster.
#
# Against the first other arm, simdutf, the summary also counts the rows
# utf is slower on beyond their interval (`<1`), the rows whose interval
# holds 1 (`~`: their spread exceeds their gap, so they cannot be called
# either way), gives the spread of the operation's geomean over the rounds
# (`±`, half its interval), and names the slowest row and its interval.
# With `-v rows=FILE`, every row against every arm goes to FILE: the row, the
# arm, both median GB/s, the median ratio and its interval, and `<`, `>`,
# or `~`.
